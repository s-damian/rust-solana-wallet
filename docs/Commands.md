## Generate Mnemonic

This command generates a new mnemonic phrase (12 words).

```bash
cargo run -- generate_seed
```

> PS: In this example we did not use a passphrase

Example of result:

```bash
BIP39 Mnemonic (random phrase): owner cherry you seek bless holiday humble rare orchard tennis cycle solid
Enter passphrase (optional):
Seed: A8FBCB43911A10E2F1A6F3289816240ED16FC0EE49F16A488E93A052BAE5169CB8E4EBAF8BC9D0F4545C5108CF11745D247582A0FD28A3095DE2A4CA28C457B5
Solana Public Key: BcHM6w7ywAsktXmmWG4Jjk2PmL2stS1K3ZKnQ6da24hk
```


## Recover Keypair

This command allows you to retrieve your seed (and therefore your private key) via a given mnemonic phrase.

```bash
cargo run -- recover_seed "<RECOVERY_PHRASE>"
```

```bash
cargo run -- recover_seed "owner cherry you seek bless holiday humble rare orchard tennis cycle solid"
```

> PS: In this example we did not use a passphrase

Example of result:

```bash
BIP39 Mnemonic (given phrase): owner cherry you seek bless holiday humble rare orchard tennis cycle solid
Enter passphrase (optional):
Seed: A8FBCB43911A10E2F1A6F3289816240ED16FC0EE49F16A488E93A052BAE5169CB8E4EBAF8BC9D0F4545C5108CF11745D247582A0FD28A3095DE2A4CA28C457B5
Solana Public Key: BcHM6w7ywAsktXmmWG4Jjk2PmL2stS1K3ZKnQ6da24hk
```


## Send SOL (lamports)

This command allows you to send Lamports to a destination address.

```bash
cargo run -- send <RECIPIENT_PUBKEY> <AMOUNT_IN_LAMPORTS>
```

```bash
cargo run -- send 27nJwboVxL39gGfwFeefiHYqrFtipmHAHgkxo3xjPJ3L 2000000
```

> PS: 2000000 Lamports = 0.002 SOL.

Example of result:

```bash
Transaction sent successfully!
```


## Get Public Key

This command allows you to view your Solana public key if you have already stored your keypair locally.

```bash
cargo run -- pubkey
```

Example of result:

```bash
Solana Public Key: BcHM6w7ywAsktXmmWG4Jjk2PmL2stS1K3ZKnQ6da24hk
```


## Get Balance by Public Key

This command allows you to see the balance of a public address.

```bash
cargo run -- balance_by_pubkey <PUBKEY>
```

```bash
cargo run -- balance_by_pubkey BcHM6w7ywAsktXmmWG4Jjk2PmL2stS1K3ZKnQ6da24hk
```

Example of result:

```bash
Balance: 0.010000000 SOL (10000000 lamports)
```


## Get help for this Wallet

This command allows you to display the available commands.

```bash
cargo run -- --help
```

Example of result:
